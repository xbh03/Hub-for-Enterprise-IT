# Hub-for-Enterprise-IT
A platform to manage service and solve some of the biggest problems in enterprise IT departments.

### **Introduction**
I have recently started thinking about a Hub, a kind of central platform for administering one's IT infrastructure, people, processes, and all that comprises the tasks of an IT department in a large company.

### **The main problem**
Something new is created to solve a problem or improve an existing production process by replacing it. 

**1. Lack of up-to-date documentation:** Information is often transferred to current staff members via e-mail, the problem is that new resources will not be able to find this information. In addition, those who receive it cannot handle it; what if there is another lost, trashed, or unreceived e-mail on the subject?

**2. Server management and virtual machines:** Knowing what a server does, what environment it is set up in, what resources it consumes, monitoring of the operating system and any applications, escalation rules, associated procedures, who is responsible for it, and a lot of other information that would help the specialist understand the actual function of the item. Saving time, solving problems already handled in the past by others, and hundreds of other positives you would imagine.

**3. List of network IPs used and available in real-time divided by VLANs:** This information is often managed within an IPAM (IP Address Management), the problem is that in large companies the IT department is usually divided into two parts, in the first part the systems engineers who manage the infrastructure, applications, etc. In the second, the network specialists who only and exclusively manage security and connections to the server, but when a system administrator has to implement something new and does not have the available IPs to associate with the new server, it becomes a problem for him for the SLAs /KPI and for the requester waiting for the working product.

In reality, there are also other problems, knowing what is associated with who, what uses what, and for how long, is essential information for managing an infrastructure.

**4. Roles and permissions:** I am sure that not everyone should read, modify, delete, or analyze data that could be kept hidden or private only for specific people and/or groups in the IT department of a large company, for this reason, accurate permission management cannot be missing, even if it's a paradox because this system was created specifically not to neglect anyone and therefore leave them out, but there is always the possibility of asking permission to carry out the desired operation.

**5. Management of tickets, change requests, and problems:** Are we going too far for this? No one has talked about developing something from scratch, we simply think of integrations, then integrate a list of activities open to the service desk and associated with the items concerned.

Having a view of the service desk activities in its own customizable view, with extractable data for analysis, but simply knowing in real time the progress of the request is essential.

**6. Projects and tasks associated with specialists:** Knowing what to do, by how much, and for what is a very important thing, there are tools with which it is possible to manage entire teams of people, unfortunately, the reality is that many companies (even large ones) still use Excel sheets for managing projects. I personally don't agree with this type of management, as an IT specialist I adapt and understand the internal dynamics, but at the same time, I would prefer something alternative but easily integrated like an Excel sheet.

Do you want to use the Excel sheet? Have the decency to share it with everyone on the corporate cloud, so that they can update it and/or observe its progress.

**7. The dashboard:** I think of a dashboard that contains a large search bar, right here I can find results of any type (obviously divided by section), the complete summary of a server with the badge (ON/OFF, open tickets, scheduled maintenance, etc.. .), documentation articles, people, projects and so on.

As background? Colors? Logos? The answer is fully customizable, put what you want in it!

**8. Automation:** This is the booster, automating a process such as creating or disposing of a VM, updating network share permissions for users, and a thousand other tasks, can allow specialists to focus on more important things!

### **As? Where to start?**
I'm sharing my idea, the project, and the code here because all this is open-source, I want to find developers, systems engineers, and all kinds of people who work or have daily contacts in the IT departments of medium-large companies, to understand really what you're talking about, and share your thoughts on it (as well as your own security and programming skills).

!!! I think that the tools that are already used in this portal can be integrated, I don't see it as a huge replacement of something within companies, who would ever do that? I'd like it if it began to be conceived as a visual only, to give a more complete view of the context to all those who need it, this alone would be an excellent goal. !!!
